You need to have `node` and `npm` installed on your system. Node version should be 20 or more.

## 1. Environment variable setup

### 1. Backend
In the backend folder, there is an `.env.example`. Rename this to just `.env` and update `DATABASE_URL`.

> ***Note:** `DATABASE_URL` should be in this format `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME:PORT"`*.

### 2. Frontend

In the frontend folder, there is an `.env.example`. Rename this to just `.env` and update `VITE_BACKEND_URL`.

> ***Note:** `VITE_BACKEND_URL` is the Backend server URL*.

## 2. Backend setup

### 1. Installing backend dependencies

Navigate to backend folder and run the following:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Running database migration
